This Quick Start requires licenses for {partner-product-short-name}. If you already own licenses for {partner-product-short-name}, you can use the Bring Your
Own License (BYOL) model.

Otherwise, purchase {partner-product-short-name} licenses from https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/index.html[Passport Advantage^] or an https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo[IBM representative^]. For assistance with Passport Advantage, see https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pao_customer.html[Passport Advantage Online for customers^].

The Quick Start templates provision an Oracle database instance using the License Included service model. Information about the costs associated with this 
service model is available at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/oracle-database-aws-best-practices/oracle-licensing-considerations.html[Oracle Licensing Considerations^].
