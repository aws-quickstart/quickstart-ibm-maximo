==== Prepare your AWS account

===== Key pair
Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in the
Region where you are planning to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair
name. You are prompted for this information during deployment. To create a key pair,
follow the instructions in the AWS documentation.
If you deploy the Quick Start for testing or proof-of-concept purposes, create a new key pair instead of specifying a key pair thatâ€™s already being used
by a production instance.

===== Amazon S3 bucket
Choose an existing S3 bucket or create a new one to store the prerequisite {partner-product-short-name} binaries
and Oracle SQL client and JDBC driver.

==== Prepare for the deployment

===== Download {partner-product-short-name} binaries and Oracle SQL client
Download {partner-product-short-name} Asset Management V7.6.1 binaries from https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/index.html[Passport Advantage^]
and then upload them to the S3 bucket you selected or created earlier. The following {partner-product-short-name} files are required:

 . IBM Enterprise Deployment (formerly known as IBM Installation Manager) binaries: IED_V1.8.8_Wins_Linux_86.zip
 . {partner-product-short-name} Asset Management V7.6.1 binaries: MAM_7.6.1.0_LINUX64.tar.gz
 . IBM WebSphere Application Server traditional V9 binaries: WAS_ND_V9.0_MP_ML.zip
 . IBM Java SDK V8 binaries:
  .. was.repo.9000.java8_part1.zip
  .. was.repo.9000.java8_part2.zip
  .. was.repo.9000.java8_part3.zip
 . Oracle sqlplus instant client:
  .. instantclient-sqlplus-linux.x64-19.6.0.0.0dbru.zip
  .. instantclient-basiclite-linux.x64-19.6.0.0.0dbru.zip
 . If you are installing a module, you need one of the following binaries.
  .. {partner-product-short-name} Energy and Utilities module binaries: MAXIMO_UTILITIES_7.6_MP_ML.zip
  .. {partner-product-short-name} Nuclear module binaries: MAX_NUCLEAR_POWER_7.6.1.zip
  .. {partner-product-short-name} Scheduler module binaries: MAM_Scheduler_7.6.7.zip
  .. {partner-product-short-name} Transportation module binaries: Max_Transportation_762IFR3.zip
  .. {partner-product-short-name} HSE module binaries: Max_HSEM_V761.zip
   ... Additionally, for the HSE module, you also need to download the latest hotfix and upload it to `s3://MaximoFilesLocation/HSE/latest_hotfix.zip`.

NOTE: Make sure you upload all the required files with the names as specified above to the same prefix in the S3 bucket, for example at `s3://MaximoFilesLocation/`, where `MaximoFilesLocation` is an input parameter in the CloudFormation templates.
