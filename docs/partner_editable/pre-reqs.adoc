==== Prepare your AWS account

===== Key pair
Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in the
Region where you are planning to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair
name. You are prompted for this information during deployment. To create a key pair,
follow the instructions in the AWS documentation.
If you deploy the Quick Start for testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend
that you create a new key pair instead of specifying a key pair thatâ€™s already being used
by a production instance.
