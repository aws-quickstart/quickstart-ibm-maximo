As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
 ** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
 ** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell(SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.
 ** AWS Elastic Load Balancer to balance traffic between the IBM Maximo application servers


* In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.
 ** IBM Maximo application servers deployed across two availability zones offering high availabiliy.
 ** Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Oracle as the database for IBM Maximo also deployed across two availability zones.
