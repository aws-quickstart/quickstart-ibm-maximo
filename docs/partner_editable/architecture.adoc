As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
 ** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
 ** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell(SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.
 ** AWS Elastic Load Balancer to balance traffic between the {partner-product-short-name} application servers


* In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.
 ** {partner-product-short-name} application servers deployed across two Availability Zones offering high availability.
 ** A deployment manager in an Auto Scaling group with its desired capacity set to one instance. It is used for configuration tasks during deployment and manages application servers.
 ** Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Oracle as the database for {partner-product-short-name} also deployed across two Availability Zones.

* Optionally, Amazon Route 53 as your public Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving your {partner-product-short-name} websiteâ€™s domain name.
